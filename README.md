# Talking Bear Flutter App

Welcome to the Talking Bear Flutter app! This project aims to recreate the delightful experience of the talking Tom game from our childhood using the latest technologies available to us. The app utilizes [Rive](https://rive.app/) for animations, Riverpod for state management, [Google Cloud Text-to-Speech AI](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech) for text-to-speech and device's built in speech-to-text functionalities, and [Chat GPT API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) for generating interesting and random responses. The primary goal is to create an interactive and cute application that listens, interacts, and generates exciting results for kids.

## Demo
Showcase some use cases and interactions of the application, highlighting the engaging and unpredictable responses from the polar bear character.

## Requirements
- Flutter 3.10.4
- Dart 3.0.3
- [Google Cloud API key](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158862)
- [OpenAI API key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key)

## Getting Started

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Check you have installed Flutter. If not, install it from [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
   ```bash
   flutter --version
   ```

2. Check you have installed Dart. If not, install it from [here](https://dart.dev/get-dart).
   ```bash
    dart --version
    ```
3. Clone project and navigate to the project directory in your terminal. 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Jaha96/interacting_bear.git
    cd interacting_bear
    ```
4. Install required dependencies.
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
5. Replace `.env.example` filename into `.env` and update your OpenAI API, Google Cloud API credentials. Example:
    ```bash
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY=your_google_cloud_api_key
    ```
6. Generate Riverpod autoclasses.
    ```bash
    flutter pub run build_runner build
    ```
7. Run the app on web.
    ```bash
    flutter run -d chrome
    ```
8. Now flutter automatically opens the web browser and runs the app.

To generate launcher icons for android and ios, run the following command:
```flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons```
